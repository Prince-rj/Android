# Android
I have done some basic android development and made some easy nice looking projects. These projects are one of the very first computer projects I actually made.
In this the first project is a dice that can be run on an android environment and we can thus use it for very important decisions and random choices we have to make in our day to day life
then i remember creating the toss it app which is a tossing app where i used some good images to show the two faces of the coin. It can be used for making random choices.
